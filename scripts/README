 scripts  - directory for utility scripts to help with ZJS development
=========

analyze
-------
    Checks a .js file to determine what ZJS modules it is using so they can be
    auto-included in the build.

bldetect
--------
    Uses dfu_util to display the sizes of the x86, arc, and boot partitions on
    an Arduino 101. Important in the old days when we were changing x86
    partition size from 144KB to 256KB. Now this is no longer needed and
    devices should be left in factory 144KB condition.

checkcopyrights
---------------
    Checks whether files in src/ have a copyright line as they should.

checkheaders
------------
    Tries to detect whether our header files include all the header files they
    depend on.

convert.py
----------
    Runs minifier on a JavaScript file and writes it out in a C string format.

leakfinder
----------
    Parses TRACE=on output of ZJS to determine whether blocks were leaked.

memorystats
-----------
    Finds/compares ROM and RAM usage for ZJS running a given JavaScript sample.

osxmountzephyr.sh
-----------------
    Creates a filesystem image for building the cross-compiler on Mac.

trlite
------
    Runs sanity checks, unit tests, etc. on the ZJS repo. This is what our
    Travis CI calls but can also be run locally.
